"""Tiny SQLite uptime store — powers per-service SLA + uptime + timeline.

One table, ``probes(ts, service, up, latency, detail)``: every probe of a monitored service
appends a row. From that we derive current status, current uptime streak, SLA over a window, and
a bucketed timeline for the dashboard. Standard library only (sqlite3, WAL mode for safe
concurrent read while the probe thread writes).

# One process-wide connection, opened lazily and reused for the process lifetime, guarded by a
# lock (ThreadingHTTPServer calls into here from a fresh thread per request, plus the background
# probe thread writes concurrently).
#
# PREVIOUSLY: every function below opened its OWN connection via `with sqlite3.connect(...) as c`.
# That `with` only wraps the transaction (commit/rollback) — it does NOT close the connection or
# release its file descriptors. Called every ~15s from the dashboard poll and every ~60s from the
# probe loop, this leaked a couple of file descriptors per call. Over ~17 days that reached the
# process's open-files limit (1024), and every subsequent request crashed `_state()` with
# `OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files` before it could write any HTTP response — which is
# exactly what showed up in the browser as `net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` / "connection lost".
